		<h4>The Introductions</h4>
		

		<h5>Well hello everyone, welcome to my first website. My name is Xavier Thomas; some of you may know me as Professor X, or Funk Master Dex, and in my previous lives I was ether a wolf, your Dad, or Fizz (LOL). So as you already know I’m a goof ball, but more importantly, I love to learn, I love to trying to figure out the inner workings of machines, including the human body. If I didn’t have a passion for computers, I would either be a heart surgeon, corporate lawyer, or a guru. A guru because I like helping others, most of my friends share with me their problems, and I try to help them figure things out. And that brings me to my main Goal. I want to change the world. I want to unite humanity as it once was thousands of years ago.  We’ve reached an age where we can live for years, longer than was normally thought possible but we’ve used that blessing to only fight amongst each other, we wage wars over the most selfish reasons, we selfishly keep the knowledge we learn to ourselves. This world has basically become a selfish place, and I want that to change. There are those who are trying to make a difference and I want to join their ranks to also become a major change. I want to see an end to wars and an end to military control over the government.</h5>
